# Research 

My research is interested in the mathematics of interacting quantum systems.

During my PhD, I have been focusing on two approximations methods dealing with _fermions_ : the Density Matrix Embedding Theory (DMET) and the Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT), which allow to compute efficiently reduced quantities such as the one-particle reduced density matrix (DMET) or the quantum one-body Green's function (DMFT).

These approximations belong to the general class of _embedding methods_, whose general philosophy is based on a "decomposition" of the one-particle Hilbert space into "fragments" (a.k.a. "clusters").
For each of them, one defines an _interacting but smaller_ subsystem, whose parameters are determined by a global self-consistent equation.

The purpose of these methods is to alleviate the curse of dimensionality associated with interacting quantum systems, and to describe _quantitatively_ interaction driven effects such as the metal-to-insulator Mott transition in the Fermi-Hubbard model.
